		<h2 class=" text-right">Project</h2>
		<p>We are pleased to announce the release of a stunning new project of apartments in Kato Paphos ~ Olivia Gardens</p>
		<p>Continuing on the success of our previous projects, Sirena Kings, Sirena Riverside, Sirena Sunrise, Sirena George, Sirena Cypria and Sirena Olympia.</p>
		<p>Set in a quiet, significantly elevated position with sea views over the rooftops of Paphos, this complex is located in a much sought after area of Kato Paphos. The natural cliffs to the rear provide a very peaceful and uncluttered setting and ensure against future building work directly overlooking the complex.</p>
