<h2>European Citizenship by investing in property – Cypriot Passport</h2>
<p>In March 2014, the Cyprus Government announced changes to the legislation that enables foreign investors to become a Cypriot (EU) citizen and obtain a Cypriot passport through naturalisation, making it more accessible and affordable than ever. One of the key benefits of the Cyprus citizenship program is that it involves a secure investment, rather than a donation like in many countries.</p>
