<p>The Cyprus investment program encourages Foreign Direct Investment which enables a non-Cypriot that meets economic criteria to acquire citizenship for himself, his family and dependent children up to the age of 28 years old. The program requires an investment of €2 million into residential real estate which should be retained for five years. Investment in other sectors is €2,500,000. Any application which includes re-sale property already used in a previous citizenship application by another applicant, increases the amount of the investment for the new application to €2,500,000. All nationalities are eligible to apply. Key factors that make Cyprus an ideal destination for investment is the highly specialized human resources, the reliable legislation and regulatory framework as well as a stable tax system and the safety and stability conditions which prevail in the country.</</p>
